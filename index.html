                        Why less people are enrolled in STEM

                    <p>
                        We believe that already this subjects are hard. So as hard as it is, it is not fun to learn. We
                        also believe that it is easier to see how things are done than to read how things are done. In
                        matric this subjects are failed probably because the is 80% theory and 20% practical, hence less
                        people are enrolled to this subjects in higher education.
