                    The term <i><u>'STEM'</u></i> is an umbrella term used to group together the distinct but
                    related technical disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. It is a
                    programme intended to prepare learners in the primary and secondary phases of their education
                    for tertiary level should they want to further their studies in the aforementioned fields
                    (Lutkevich, 2022). The outcome of such a programme is learners who are capable of critical
                    thinking, yielding a robust response to various problems emerging in the real world.

                It is clear that the fields of STEM are related one way or another. The underperformance of one
                field
                has an effect on the rest of the others. Subjects such as mathematics are a core principle in
                problem-solving,

                    We believe that these subjects are already difficult. So as difficult as they are, they are not
                    fun
                    to learn. We
                    also believe that it is easier to see how things are done than to read about them. In
                    matric, these subjects are failed probably because there is 80% of theory and 20% practical
                    work.
                    Hence, less
                    people are enrolled to these subjects in higher education due to the fear of failure.
